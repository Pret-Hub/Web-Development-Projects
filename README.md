# Web-Development-Projects
Here, I have uploaded all the minor projects which i have made throughout my journey of learning Front-end Web Development. Mainly i have used Html, CSS and JS for learning purpose. I still have many things to learn and several projects to build and i hope that i will upload more projects in my Github account.
